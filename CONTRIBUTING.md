Participation in this project is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## What should I know before I get started?

The Open Network Paper Translation Project is a collection of LaTeX documents containing translations of The Open Network's whitepapers. 

You should familiarize yourself with the repository structure and the LaTeX syntax before making contributions. Additionally, a working knowledge of Git and GitHub will prove invaluable.

## How can I contribute?

### Improve existing content

If you want to improve existing content, make sure your modifications are accurate and make the document better. In particular, we welcome improvements to translation and layout.

### Translate

If you are bilingual and wish to contribute to the translation effort, we would greatly appreciate your help.

### Report bugs/errors

If you come across a bug or an error in one of the documents, please create a new issue on GitHub describing the issue. We will work on resolving it as quickly as we can.

### Suggest Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature that you think would improve the project, open a new issue on GitHub. Describe your idea in as much detail as you can.

## Style Guidelines

Please make sure your contribution adheres to:

- The LaTeX document conventions.
- Follow the document structure and the commenting style of the existing `.tex` documents.

## Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the template
2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
